# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Prime Language Support" extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Simple syntax highlighting

## Version 0.0.1

This had simple syntax highlighting but it used the old syntax with for example ยง as comments.

## Version 0.0.2

This is the initial release of the Prime Language Support Extension. In this version, we have introduced basic language support with syntax highlighting. Although it is a simple implementation, it sets the foundation for future updates and enhancements to the extension. We have also updated the syntax to the new one.

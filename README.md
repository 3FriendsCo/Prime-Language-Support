<br>
Syntax highlighting is a crucial aspect of any programming language, as it enhances code readability and helps you identify different elements within your Prime code. With our extension, you can enjoy vibrant and visually appealing syntax highlighting, which will make it easier for you to identify keywords, variables, functions, and other important components of your Prime programs.

## Compiler Integration

Our Prime Language Support Extension goes beyond syntax highlighting and offers a powerful compiler integration directly within Visual Studio Code. This means that you can compile and execute your Prime programs without leaving your development environment. This seamless integration saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on your coding tasks and quickly iterate on your code.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues with the Prime Language Support Extension:

- <strong>Incomplete Keyword Support:</strong> Currently, not all keywords have been added to the syntax highlighting. We are actively working on expanding the coverage to ensure that all Prime language keywords are properly highlighted.

- <strong>Compiler Not Included:</strong> We regret to inform you that the compiler functionality is not included in the current version of the extension. However, we are diligently working on integrating a powerful compiler to enable seamless execution of Prime programs directly within Visual Studio Code.

- <strong>Color Accuracy:</strong> Please note that there may be instances where the colors used for syntax highlighting might not accurately represent your preferred color scheme. We understand the importance of customizable and visually pleasing code representations, and we are actively addressing this issue to provide better color choices in future updates.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve the Prime Language Support Extension. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us enhance the extension and provide you with a superior programming experience.

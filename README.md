Welcome to the Lotus Language Support extension! We're thrilled you've chosen Lotus as your preferred programming language.

## Syntax Highlighting

<br>
Syntax highlighting is an essential feature for any programming languageâ€”it dramatically improves code readability and assists you in distinguishing various elements within your Lotus code. Our extension offers vibrant, visually striking syntax highlighting, making it effortless to identify keywords, variables, functions, and other crucial components of your Lotus programs.

## Auto Formatting

In the settings, you have the option to enable auto-formatting, which automatically enhances the visual appeal of your code. While this feature won't optimize your code's performance, it will significantly improve its readability for all users.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues with the Lotus Language Support Extension:

- <strong>Incomplete Keyword Support:</strong> Currently, not all keywords have been added to the syntax highlighting. We are actively working on expanding the coverage to ensure that all Lotus language keywords are properly highlighted.

- <strong>Auto Formatter Not Included:</strong> We regret to inform you that the auto formatting functionality is not included in the current version of the extension. However, we are diligently working on integrating a powerful auto formatter within Visual Studio Code.

- <strong>Color Accuracy:</strong> Please note that there may be instances where the colors used for syntax highlighting might not accurately represent your preferred color scheme. We understand the importance of customizable and visually pleasing code representations, and we are actively addressing this issue to provide better color choices in future updates.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve the Lotus Language Support Extension. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us enhance the extension and provide you with a superior programming experience.

Welcome to the Lotus Language Support extension! We are delighted that you have chosen Lotus as your programming language of choice. This extension is specifically designed to enhance your coding experience by providing essential features such as syntax highlighting and a compiler to run your Lotus programs seamlessly within Visual Studio Code.

## Syntax Highlighting

<br>
Syntax highlighting is a crucial aspect of any programming language, as it enhances code readability and helps you identify different elements within your Lotus code. With our extension, you can enjoy vibrant and visually appealing syntax highlighting, which will make it easier for you to identify keywords, variables, functions, and other important components of your Lotus programs.

## Auto Formatting

In the settings you can choose if you want your code to be auto formatted to automatically make it look better or not. This will not optimize your code but it will make it more readable for everyone.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues with the Lotus Language Support Extension:

- <strong>Incomplete Keyword Support:</strong> Currently, not all keywords have been added to the syntax highlighting. We are actively working on expanding the coverage to ensure that all Lotus language keywords are properly highlighted.

- <strong>Auto Formatter Not Included:</strong> We regret to inform you that the auto formatting functionality is not included in the current version of the extension. However, we are diligently working on integrating a powerful auto formatter within Visual Studio Code.

- <strong>Color Accuracy:</strong> Please note that there may be instances where the colors used for syntax highlighting might not accurately represent your preferred color scheme. We understand the importance of customizable and visually pleasing code representations, and we are actively addressing this issue to provide better color choices in future updates.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve the Lotus Language Support Extension. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us enhance the extension and provide you with a superior programming experience.
